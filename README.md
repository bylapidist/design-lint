**@lapidist/design-lint** keeps JavaScript, TypeScript and style sheets aligned with your design system. It validates design tokens, flags unsupported components and offers rich formatting options for continuous integration pipelines.

## Quick start

**@lapidist/design-lint** requires Node.js ≥22. The commands below either run the linter once via `npx` or install it locally, initialise configuration, and lint your `src` directory. For deeper CLI details, see the [Usage guide](docs/usage.md).

```bash
# run without installing
npx @lapidist/design-lint@latest src

# or add to your project
npm install --save-dev @lapidist/design-lint
npx design-lint init
npx design-lint src
```

See the [Usage guide](docs/usage.md) for the full command reference.

## Why design-lint?

General purpose linters understand code style, not design systems. `@lapidist/design-lint` bridges that gap by enforcing token usage and component conventions across your codebase.

### Token awareness
`@lapidist/design-lint` flags raw values that bypass design tokens, keeping colour, spacing and typography consistent. Learn more in the [rule reference](docs/rules/index.md).

### Auto-fixes
Run with `--fix` to automatically replace deprecated tokens or components and tidy up your code. See the [usage guide](docs/usage.md) for fix options.

### Broad language support
Lint JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, SCSS, Sass and Less, including inline styles and tagged template literals.

### Extensible
Extend behaviour with custom rules, formatters and plugins for your design system.

| Advantage | @lapidist/design-lint | Generic linters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design token validation | ✅ | ❌ |
| Component deprecation warnings | ✅ | ❌ |
| Multi-language style + code linting | ✅ | ⚠️ (varies) |

## Why teams choose design-lint {#why-design-lint}

design-lint brings design decisions into your repositories so visual integrity stays intact
from pull request to production. By understanding Design Token Interchange Format (DTIF)
files natively, the linter speaks the same language as your design platform and codebase.

### Purpose-built for design tokens

- Normalise typography, colour, spacing, and motion values with the canonical DTIF parser.
- Align components and styling to shared tokens instead of duplicating constants per
  project.
- Catch drift early with granular diagnostics that explain what to fix and why it matters.

### Shared context for designers and engineers

- Give engineers the same terminology designers use when reviewing UI implementation.
- Extend the core rule set to cover organisation-specific patterns and naming schemes.
- Surface actionable feedback in editors, terminals, and continuous integration jobs.

## Make tokens actionable in any stack {#make-tokens-actionable}

design-lint recognises frameworks and file types common to design system work so teams can
adopt linting without changing their tools.

- Enforce component usage and props across React, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla projects.
- Lint styles authored in CSS, CSS-in-JS, and preprocessors while respecting token
  semantics.
- Generate consistent output through built-in formatters or your own custom pipeline.

## Automate with confidence {#automation}

Integrate the linter wherever code ships to production. Deterministic results make it easy
to gate pull requests or fail builds when design conventions regress.

- Command-line usage fits into npm scripts, Nx workspaces, and other task runners.
- CI recipes cover GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and other popular platforms.
- Cached runs and incremental linting keep feedback loops fast for large repositories.

## Get involved {#get-involved}

The project welcomes feedback from teams putting design-lint into practice.

- Share migration stories, workflows, and fixes in the [guides](/usage) to help others.
- Contribute new [rules](/rules/) or [formatters](/formatters) that capture your
  organisation's needs.
- Explore the [examples](/examples/index) to start quickly or open a PR when you improve
  them.

Join us in building automation that keeps design systems and implementation in sync.

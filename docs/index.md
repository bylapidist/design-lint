# design-lint Documentation

`design-lint` helps teams enforce design system rules across JavaScript,
TypeScript and CSS codebases. These docs cover installation, usage and
configuration of the linter.

## Getting Started

Requires Node.js 18 or later.

Install and run the CLI against your project:

```bash
npx design-lint src
```

Refer to the [Usage](usage.md) guide for all available command line options and
to [Configuration](configuration.md) for setting up design tokens and rules.
